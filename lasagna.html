        <h2>Recipe Description </h2>
        <p>My grandmother's hamburger casserole is classic comfort food! Featuring ground beef, noodles, and a creamy cheese sauce, this simple recipe dates back to the 1940's. You can tweak the amount of cheese and sour cream depending on what you've got in the fridge â€” it'll still turn out great!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients list</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Cooking Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease.</li>
            <li>Mix tomato sauce, sugar, garlic salt, and salt into the ground beef; simmer until flavors blend, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover the skillet.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook egg noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>While the egg noodles are cooking, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Mix sour cream, cream cheese, and onion together in a bowl.</li>
        </ol>
